## Quick Setup Example
- Read 'How to set up the bot' section if you don't know how to get some of these vars.
    - This assumes you have some knowledge of Discord/Docker/. If unsure, skip this section.
- Check .envExamples for a full list of all vars.
- Check docker-compose.yml for more examples
```yml
services:
  sassbot:
    image: ghcr.io/bombg/sassbot:latest
    container_name: Sassbot
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      SECRET: 'token' # string, the bot token you are given by discord
      GUILD_ID: discordGuildIdHere # int, the guild ID of the discord server the bot is in
      whiteListedRoleIDs: '[id1,id2]' # int, User IDs and/or Role IDs of white listed people/roles
      KICK_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID: channelId # int, id of the notification channel for Kick
      kickUserName: '["kickUserName"]' # str, user name of the Kick streamer
```

### How to set up the bot:

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers and set up an app and get a token. Put that token in .envExample file with the var SECRET.
2. At https://discord.com/developers/ - generate an invite code under oauth2 to invite your bot to your server. Under scope make sure bot is checked.
    Give the bot permissions you want it to have. At minimum it'll need to be able to post messages and embeds
3. Go to the bot section in the developers portal and turn on all the intents.
4. In the .envExample file, change the GUILD_ID value to the guild id of your server, and each platform NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID's to the channel ID you want alerts posted to.
    To easily get both of these IDs, in discord advanced options turn on developer mode. After that you can right click servers/channels and a new option to copy the IDs will be available.
    Also edit and add vairus URLs to your streamer in .envExample. Everything is described in comments.
    - After editing .envExample rename it to .env - This will be used before default values. 
5. Replace images in the image folder with those of your streamer, but keep same file names. OR change their paths in .env
    - images/errIcon.png - icon used for embeds if there is an issue getting one from the platform, or if one doesn't exist
    - images/twitErrImg.jpg - default photo used for embeds if no other thumbnail or photo can be grabbed from the image list (if its empty)
    - images/avatars/calmStreamer.png - Bot avatar if streamer has streamed within the MIN_TIME_BEFORE_AVATAR_CHANGE time frame (default 48 hours)
    - images/avatars/pissedStreamer.png - Bot avatar if streamer hasn't streamed within the MIN_TIME_BEFORE_AVATAR_CHANGE time frame
6. Make sure you have python 3.10 installed.
    - make sure you have Chrome/Chromium another browser may work but not tested. 
    - Make sure Xvfb is installed if on Linux. Xephyr, or Xvnc may work but untested 
    - run command 'pip install -r requirements.txt' 
7. Start the bot: 'python3 run.py' or 'python run.py'

### How To: Docker Compose or Portainer

1. Install Docker
2. Install Docker Compose and/or Portainer
3. Complete steps 1-5 above in the "how to set up the bot" section
4. Edit docker-compose.yml and follow the commented instructions
5. If using docker compose, from the Sassbot directory start it via "sudo docker compose up -d"
6. If using Portainer go to stacks > add stack 
    -  Copy paste over the non commented code from docker-compose.yml into the window
    -  Deploy Stack

### Known Issues

1. If multiple accounts are streaming on the same platform at the same time, /rebroadcast will only show an announcement for one of the accounts.
2. Cam4 will ban your IP if you make too many calls from the same ip to the api. Make check times very long and/or rotate your ip
3. Fansly will 404 you for a period of time if you make too many requests from the same ip.
4. If the requesting ip is in a state that requires age verification, some of these checkers wont work.
